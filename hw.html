    <h3> JK Rowling</h3>
    <h5>Joanne Rowling (born 31 July 1965), known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author
    and philanthropist. She is the author of Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy novel series published from 1997 to 2007.
    The series has sold over 600 million copies, has been translated into 84 languages, and has spawned a global media
    franchise including films and video games. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias
    Robert Galbraith.</h5>

    <h1>Section 2</h1>
    <h3> Her books</h3>
    <h5>Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the
    idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her
    first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and
    the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly
    Hallows (2007). By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.
    
    The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort.
    Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman
    (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in
    the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more
    mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as
    regressive. There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.</h5>
